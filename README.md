Updated Ely addon with new ui and the newest aoa also a new game+ asset. Thank you @Ely for the artwork, @kingddd for testing the new game+ art, and @Astro for making the config.

"Don't look back"/"Sorry about that Bye Bye" aoa text asset by @PatManDX 
This newest addon has a config so you can disable as you will. For example if you want to use a different bustup that's in the base femc mod, just turn off the bustup via the config button in reloaded 2, have a good day everyone.
